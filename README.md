<h1>About Date for BackdropCMS</h1>
-------------------------

This module is a port to Backdrop of the Drupal contributed module 'Date'. 
It provides both a flexible date/time field type Date field and a Date API that other modules can use. 

The following modules are included within Date

date_all_day;  date_api;  date_popup (but without the dropdown timepicker option);  date_repeat;  date_tools;  date_views

The date_context module is not included because it requires the Context module.

<h2>Status</h2>
This port to Backdrop is ready for installation and testing.
7th June - Main module and Date API module have been revised and basic functions work. Others to follow.

This port to Backdrop would not, of course, be possible without all the work done by the developers and maintainers of the Drupal module.
