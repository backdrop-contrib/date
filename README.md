<h1>About Date for Backdrop</h1>
-------------------------

This module is now obsolete and should not now be used. It was previously replaced by a version 'Date Basic' with reduced scope, and not all porting issues were dealt with in this version of 'Date' which is an attempt at porting  the Drupal contributed module 'Date'which provides both a flexible date/time field type Date field and a Date API that other modules can use. 

The reduced functionality of Date Basic has now been included in core in Backdrop v1.2 and remaining functions are being made available in contributed modules date_all_day, date_tools and date_repeat. Please see these modules for more details

The date_context module is not included because it requires the Context module.

This port to Backdrop would not, of course, be possible without all the work done by the developers and maintainers of the Drupal module.
