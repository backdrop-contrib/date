Date
====

**Important note**: Date module was moved into Backdrop core in version 1.2.0. 
Use of this module is no longer necessary and no further changes will be made 
here. If you would like to report a bug or feature request against Date module, 
file an issue in the main Backdrop CMS core repository at https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues.

Provides both a flexible date/time field type Date field and a Date API that other modules can use.
